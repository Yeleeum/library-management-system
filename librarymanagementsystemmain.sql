The whole concept and format of CISSE 2005 was very exciting and ground-breaking. The powerpoint presentations, final paper manuscripts and time schedule for live presentations over the web had been available for 3 weeks prior to the start of the conference for all registrants, so they could pick and choose the presentations they want to attend and think about questions that they might want to ask. The live audio presentations were also recorded and are part of the permanent CISSE archive, which includes all power point presentations, papers and recorded presentations.\r\n\r\nAll aspects of the conference were managed on-line; not only the reviewing, submissions and registration processes; but also the actual conference. Conference participants - authors, presenters and attendees - only needed an internet connection and sound available on their computers in order to be able to contribute and participate in this international ground-breaking conference. The on-line structure of this high-quality event allowed academic professionals and industry participants to contribute work and attend world-class technical presentations based on rigorously refereed submissions, live, without the need for investing significant travel funds or time out of the office. Suffice to say that CISSE received submissions from more than 50 countries, for whose researchers, this opportunity presented a much more affordable, dynamic and well-planned event to attend and submit their work to, versus a classic, on-the-ground conference.\r\n\r\nThe CISSE conference audio room provided superb audio even over low speed internet connections, the ability to display PowerPoint presentations, and cross-platform compatibility (the conferencing software runs on Windows, Mac, and any other operating system that supports Java). In addition, the conferencing system allowed for an unlimited number of participants, which in turn granted CISSE the opportunity to allow all participants to attend all presentations, as opposed to limiting the number of available seats for each session.\r\n\r\nThe implemented conferencing technology, starting with the submission & review system and ending with the online conferencing capability, allowed CISSE to conduct a very high quality, fulfilling event for all participants.', 'Engineering', 'High-Performance Computing, Software Engineering, Information Retrieval, Database Systems', '2006', 12078, 10, '1-S, 4-R'),

The first book, Balakanda, tells the story of Rama\'s childhood and his marriage to Sita. The second book, Ayodhyakanda, describes the events leading up to Rama\'s exile to the forest. The third book, Aranyakanda, describes Rama\'s life in the forest and his encounters with various sages and demons. The fourth book, Kishkindhakanda, tells the story of Rama\'s meeting with Hanuman and his battle against the demon king Vali. The fifth book, Sundarakanda, describes the events leading up to the discovery of Sita\'s whereabouts. The sixth book, Lankakanda, describes the battle between Rama and Ravana, and the seventh book, Uttarakanda, tells the story of Rama\'s return to Ayodhya and his coronation as king.\r\n\r\nRamcharitramanas is considered to be one of the most important works of Hindi literature and has had a profound impact on the devotional traditions of Hinduism. It is often recited in temples and homes during religious ceremonies and festivals, and has been adapted into numerous plays, films, and musical compositions.', 'Devotional', 'Ramcharitmanas, ramayana, shri ram katha', '2nd', 1780, 34, '2-S, 5-R');
